Another tool that I stumbled upon, on my Node.js adventure, is Stylus. Stylus is yet another CSS preprocessor, just like [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Less](http://lesscss.org/). CSS preprocessors have recently become quite popular, and while I had studied Less[.js] and knew about Sass, I hadn't used them at all. But now I've been using Stylus, and I've got to say it's quite handy.

Stylus' creators describe it as an "*Expressive, robust, feature-rich CSS language built for nodejs*". It's very similar to Jade, the HTML prepocessor that I recently blogged about, but for CSS. It's got the same pythonic style (indentation to describe code blocks) as Jade, and very similar in many respects. Like Jade, it's got built-in scripting, but in Stylus it's implemented a bit differently. I think it's handy to have scripting support, but in Stylus it's kind of awkward. Jade enables JavaScript scripting, but Stylus has it's own scripting language. I would have wanted to see Stylus implement it in the same fashion as Jade did. But apart from that, I really like Stylus. Nested CSS styles, functions and mixins, awkward-but-functional scripting and all kinds of features I'll probably never use.

All in all, very awesome and you should definitely take a look at it. Start out by reading the [documentation](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/) and then head over to the [Stylus repository at GitHub](https://github.com/learnboost/stylus/) and download it (or get it via `npm`).
