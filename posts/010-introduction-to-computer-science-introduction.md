I just went to my first class, which was *Introduction to Computer Science*. It was basically an introduction to the course. The teacher described the course perfectly. He said that the course was a preparation for computer science cocktail parties. So, when you're in a cocktail party with other computer scientists, and they are talking about some nerdy computer science stuff, you won't be lying when you nod and say "yes, aha". So the course will be a mix of computer science knowledge and history.

We were also given our first assignment, which is to keep a log of a whole day in our life, and then analyze that log and try to connect it to computing. Like, for example, when we're brushing our teeths, are we doing it mechanically (like a computer) or are we doing it differently each time? So an interesting first assignment.

We are also supposed to read Chapter 1 (pages 1-18) of [Computing Book](http://www.computingbook.org/) and an article about *Declarative vs. imperative knowledge*, but the link to that is apparently missing.

But the course definitely looks promising and I'm already looking forward to learning more.
