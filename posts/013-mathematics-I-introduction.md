The Mathematics I introduction was yesterday. The course layout was pretty normal, presentations twice a week, problem set weekly and so on.

We also did a review. We went through the basic number sets ($\mathbb{N}, \mathbb{N}_0, \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R}$), set operations ($\cup, \cap, \in$), set definition, the empty set ($\emptyset$), intervals, the absolute function and the triangle inequality ($|a \pm b| \le |a| + |b|$). And that's pretty much it.

There will also be a simple algebra test next week which will make sure we review our algebra before we dive in deeper.
