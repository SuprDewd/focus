Definitely one of my favorite subjects is algorithms. Lucky me, there is a course titled *Algorithms* being taught at my school. It's actually the third semester programming course, but I had previously taken the second semester course (*Data Structures*), and will be taking the final exam in the first semester programming course (*Programming*) next week. I'll let you know how it goes. But anyway, I went to my first *Algorithms* class today and, like in the other courses, we got an introduction.

The format of this course will be a little different, but we'll actually by taking [Algorithm's, Part I on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). It's an online course provided by Princeton University. We're supposed to view selected lectures from there, and then we'll talk more about (or somehow branch out from) the contents of the lectures. There will also be regular assignments, problems, quizzes, and so on. We'll also be using an "online classroom" on the side, called [Piazza](https://piazza.com/). There we'll be able to ask questions and answer questions which our classmates posted. I think this format will be pretty neat.

Anyway, the first school day is finished. It was a long, but very exciting, day. Now I've got to go catch some sleep. Tomorrow's classes are *Discrete Mathematics* and *Mathematics I*.
